Semi-supervised learning is a class of supervised learning tasks and techniques that also make use of unlabeled data for training â€“ typically a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.

## The Data - STL-10
In this problem we are given 5,000 labeled images and 100,000 unlabeled images. 
- Colored 96x96 images
- Labeled images belong to one of the 10 classes
- The unlabeled 100,000 images contain other classes of images as well as the 10 given classes.
